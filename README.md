 ### patch-wise skull shape completion

The deep learning model is trained to perform the following actions:

```
1. scan the entire skull in a (3D) patch-wise manner
2. if patch contains no defected region:
3.     output the input
4. if patch contains the defected region:
5.     output the input and the missing part 
6. scan complete
7. patch stitched together
8. output: completed skull
```

### patch-wise direct implant generation
The missing part (i.e., the implant) can also be predicted directly without reconstructing the original skull, if the deep learning models are trained with the implants as the ground truth.

```
1. scan the entire skull in a (3D) patch-wise manner
2. if patch contains no defected region:
3.     output an empty (all 0) patch 
4. if patch contains the defected region:
5.     output only the missing part 
6. scan complete
7. patch stitched together
8. output:  implant
```

### interpretation of learnt features for volumetric shape completion (Interpretable Deep Learning)
For better visualization, the 3D patch as well as the 3D feature maps are projected into a 2D plane.
We observe that the features learnt by a deep learning model for the volumetric shape completion task are interpretable and consistent/stable. 
The good interpretibility is large due to the <em>lightweight</em> nature (binary, sparse) of the skull data.
